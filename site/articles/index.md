# Mandelbrot

I grew up in the 1980s and was surrounded by computers almost from the beginning. We lived in Hungary behind the iron curtain and could consider ourselves lucky as it was extraordinary if someone had a PC at home. Only a few of my classmates heard about computers at all, let alone saw one. We had a Commodore VIC-20 and I wrote my first programs at the age of 10, later a dream came true when I got a Commodore 64 (C64) in 1991.

By the end of the 1980s the C64 became the de facto gaming machine amongst my friends. Games came mostly from pirate sources with crack screens offering unlimited lives and invulnerability. Those were completely different times...

Things had changed soon after and the Commodore and ZX machines were phased out as everyone switched to IBM PCs. It all started with the XTs and ATs with monochrome or CGA displays, and later with more advanced machines. By the time I got to secondary school in 1994, the school had one or two Pentium machines as well.

I often find myself nostalgic about those times and decided to learn the details of those ancient machines a bit. 

And just what could be better than a Mandelbrot drawer? It's complex enough (it's about complex numbers after all), everyone knows it and it just looks great.

I plan to implement it on various platforms. Right now I have a C64 and an x86 version. I want to go back some more to the PDP-1 or IBM 1401 era, or even to the ENIAC, but we will see how it goes...
